# ITDEV115-Intermediate-Object-Oriented-Programming

**FINAL PROJECT**-  This project brought all the concepts we learned in this class together.  A file was given to us with several names and each name had a list of numbers, each representing a test score.  The object was to use encapsulation, inheritance, several classes, data hiding, file I/O, and other concepts to read the data, parse it into manageable arrays, and then calculate test scores.
